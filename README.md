# Atliq-Hospitality-Report
I prepared Power BI Report based on Hospitality data provided by Youtube Channel 'CodeBasics', link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT4V7zguCnc. I did the report by myself with some guidance from CodeBasics channel. 

In the video provided by CodeBasics there was an interview with Revenue Manager that works for a Hospitality business. What I learnt from that dicussion is that in hospitality business it is very important to price rooms in your hotels properly as you may be missing out on opportunities to earn more revenue during peak seasons. 
In the attached Hospitality Report it is visible that these hotels have flat prices and first thing that should be implemented is introduction of price diferances between WeekDays and Weekends. Also some hotels have low occupancy rates that corrspond with low Ratings from customers. These hotels should be further analysed by Hotel business.

It was an interesting guided project for me. I could practice creation of Power BI visualisations and DAX measures fully by myself which was a great training. I could also learn more about hospitality business and key metrics that are used in its data analysis.
