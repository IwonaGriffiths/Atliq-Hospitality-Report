# Atliq-Hospitality-Report
I prepared Power BI Report based on Hospitality data provided by [Youtube Channel 'CodeBasics'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT4V7zguCnc). I did the report by myself with some guidance from CodeBasics channel. 

In the video provided by CodeBasics, there was an interview with a Revenue Manager who works in the hospitality industry. From that discussion, I learned that in the hospitality business, it is crucial to price hotel rooms properly, as underpricing during peak seasons can lead to missed revenue opportunities. In the attached Hospitality Report, it is evident that some hotels maintain flat pricing, and the first recommendation would be to implement price differentiation between weekdays and weekends. Additionally, some hotels have low occupancy rates, which correlate with low customer ratings. These hotels should be further analyzed by the business.

This was an interesting guided project for me. I had the opportunity to practice creating Power BI visualizations and DAX measures independently, which was excellent training. I also gained insights into the hospitality industry and the key metrics used in its data analysis.
